## Introduction

Hello, my name is Damai Subimawanto, and this is my simple project of Android. The purpose of this project is for my interview test, and also for increasing my knowledge and improving my skill in new Android technologies (for me).

It is a very simple app, it only consists of 2 pages: Main page and Detail page.
The main page consists of an EditText box and a RecyclerView for the user searched list. The detail user page consists of a header section of selected user info and a list of user's Github Repo list.
